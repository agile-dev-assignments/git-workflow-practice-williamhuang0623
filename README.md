The idea of sourcing offchain information through decentralized oracles to enhance payment security improves upon blockchain-based payments as we know today. Even as crypto products become widely available, crypto payments have yet to be adopted in the mainstream. One of the biggest obstacles facing crypto payment products today is the difficulty in transacting crypto payments simply (e.g. without large hex-denomianted address strings, or even QR codes) yet privately. This article goes into how decentralized oracles can alleviate the problem by providing double-blind verifiability between senders and recipients while maintaining the trustless properties of crypto payments through off-chain data, such as social media profiles.
